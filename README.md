# Unity Learning Project before Space Quest
Experimental repository for unity game development before the space quest
This file contains the contents that I have been working on. Currently it should have a main menu and a cacat game scene. To check if the game is working, try running the game after you cloned it and open it with unity. 
you can click the start button in the main menu, then you can press WASD to move the character around, and click space bar to use ultimate attackkkkkk
if you cannot run the game, it might be due to incorrect version of unity or you might be using the old input system. Make sure your unity version is 2020.3.181f1. Otherwise, go to unity and select Window > Package Manager > Packages: Unity Registry > type: "input system" in the search bar and click install. 

We have 3 branches in this repository: dev, project_testing, stable_version. Usually we will all work on the dev branch. When we reach a point where we have more extra features, we will merge the testing branch with the dev branch. After making sure everything works fine, we will merge stable_version branch with the testing branch again. 
Consider testing branch is the backup branch and stable_version is the backup of the backup branch.

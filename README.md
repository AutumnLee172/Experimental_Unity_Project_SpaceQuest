# Project Kyoiku: Stellar into the Galaxy

Presented by Team Coding Jouzu. This repository contains the source code for our demo solution to the Space Quest Challenge. 
We have used Unity as the game engine to develop the game, thus this source code contains unity meta files and requires unity to run. We have published the demo with WebGL, you may access it with this link: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/jouzu-ocp However, please note that there is a resolution problem when compiling the game to WebGL, hence you might see some of the objects are not aligned properly. 

There might be some unused and not related assets in the folders, but most of the assets used in the gameplay are produced by our own team members. 

Thank you and have a great day!!
